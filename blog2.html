        <h1 class="head">How to Plan a Roadtrip</h1>
        <p class="subhead">July 24, 2017<br>by Nick</p><br>
        <p class="firstp">Road trips are one of the most affordable ways to travel. A week long vacation to Paris might cost a few thousand dollars – or an average of several hundred dollars per day. In contrast, I took a solo road trip in 2015 that lasted 34 days and cost a total of $1600. That’s less than $50 per day!</p>

        <p>In this post I’ll tell you the guidelines that Jackie and I are using to plan our upcoming road trip of 30 days, 5500 miles, and budget of $40/person/day.</p><br>

        <h5>1.  Plan your route based on the people that you know</h5><p>This is not only more fun, but (if your friends and family have room for you) comes with the added bonus of a warm shower and clean bed or sofa to sleep on. On my previous road trip, I stayed with friends or family more than twice as many times as on my own. They took me to all their favorite local restaurants or parks and I didn’t have to spend 60 bucks a night on a motel.</p>

        <p>This time around, Jackie and I are planning to visit friends and family everywhere from Charlotte to El Paso. Seeing our loved ones is the main attraction to most of the towns and cities that we’ll be hitting on this journey.</p><br>

        <h5>2.  Pack light</h5><p>Not only are Jackie and I going on a month-long trip, we’re moving to San Diego in the process. We’ve already sold many of our belongings and will be taking mostly essentials with us. No furniture, no TV, nothing larger than an acoustic guitar.</p>

        <p>To make even better use of space, we took all the seats out of our van and put a car-top carrier on the roof. In addition to being easier to move, having fewer possessions will save us on gas mileage. After 5,000 miles those savings can really add up.</p><br>

        <h5>3.  Go camping</h5><p>Another way to keep your money from the hotels is to camp when you’re not near family or friends. National Forests make for the best camping in my opinion, but local, state, and national parks can work as well.</p><br>

        <h5>4.  Plan your first few days rigidly, and your last few loosely</h5><p>For our first few days we know exactly where we’ll be on the road and who we’ll be visiting. By the end of our itinerary all we know is we’ll be “somewhere in California.” This ensures our trip gets off to a good start, while giving us flexibility to adapt our plans for later. We didn’t even bother planning which parks or attractions to see at the end of the trip; this research can be done later during the long hours on the road.</p><br>

        <h5>5.  Build “buffer days” into your schedule</h5><p>This is similar in concept to number 4, but "buffer days" are planned empty days in our itinerary. We might use a buffer day to spend and extra night with family, go off course to see a bonus National Monument, or just to get ahead on the road toward our next destination.</p><br>

        <h5>6.  Eat cheaply</h5><p>Save your money for cool restaurants for when you’re visiting someone who knows what they’re doing. When on the road, stick to PB&Js and protein bars. Avoid fast food unless you really need to get something quick.</p><br>

        <h5>7.  Stick to a budget</h5><p>Finally, get an idea of what you have to spend ahead of time. I knew from my 2015 road trip that I spent about $50 per day. Here was the breakdown by category:</p><br>

        <p>Because Jackie and I are travelling together this time, we can split the cost between 2 people. Being conservative, we should be able to spend less than $40 per person per day on this trip. You can see our planned route in our first post <a href="blog1.html" style="text-transform: lowercase;"> here.</a></p>
