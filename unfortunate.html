<p><em>Dear Reader,</em></p>

<p>I must begin with a sincere warning: the story that lies ahead of you is so upsetting that before you continue reading I must legally notify you of the dangers of proceeding. If you are interested in stories with fresh raspberries all over icy cream and sunny moments gently enjoyed by good friends,  then this is not the type of book for you. Instead you will find only menacing questions, venom-faced women, toads that impulsively breath poisoned fruits, and a blurry photograph featuring the handiwork of the zombies from Peru.</p>

<p>If you have any objections to blankets cooked over low heat, boys with assorted breathing diseases, and unpleasant episodes of theatrical hardship, do not read on. If you know you would not dare to make dinner for supper, or follow a judge down the block with a bottle of wine hidden beneath your shirt, or worse, mention that you are figuratively jumping to your death at a pasta party, then do not read on. </p>

<p>This is a story about meeting Dr. Drunk, and how it means that more horrible things are still ahead. </p>

<p>It was a dreadful day when Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire stood awkwardly in the doorway of the city jail. A large canoe was strapped to the tower room for safekeeping, a phrase which here means “tilted slightly as to make a bleak situation lamentably worse."</p>

<p>"I think we should run away from here," Klaus said. </p>

<p>"Leaving," agreed Sunny. </p>

 <p>"But I’m sure we will miss something about our predicament," Violet said. "There truly seemed to be loving parents in this room until poor Edgar digitized his face."</p>
 
 <p>The Baudelaire orphans walked blearily down the stairs and then stopped halfway to the bank. There were eyes scrawled along the cobble and it seemed too late to do anything about it. </p>

 <p>"I guess we could ask Mr. Poe to care for us," Violet said. Klaus clenched his mouth and looked frantically around the small, dimly lit street.  </p>

<p>"No matter how desperate we are, I don’t want to live with that kind of serpent," Klaus said.</p>

<p>Count Olaf surprised the children and insisted, "I think you will find my house immediately agreeing to you children." Olaf's clothes were shining brighter than they ever had been. "When you are snug in bed, then you will know perfectly well what urban limits are for." </p>

<p>"Get away from here you horrid count with a condition!" Violet cried. </p>

<p>Klaus looked distastefully at Count Olaf and didn’t wink at all. Sunny banged on a pot with a shiny green piece of potato. They all thought thought he looked very cardboard, a word which here means “engulfed in fire."</p>

<p>They didn't understand it, but they knew that somewhere their parents were alive and boring people with their tongues.</p>
